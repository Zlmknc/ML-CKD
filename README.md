# Chronic Kidney Disease
In order to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD), nine different classification algorithms from machine learning methods were performed by undergoing three processes: baseline performance, feature selection by genetic algorithms, and feature extraction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

# Introduction
This study aims at the accurate diagnosis of individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
The performance of different machine learning algorithms was compared using an open-source Kaggle data set obtained from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. 
In the study;
* 10-fold cross-validation 
* genetic algorithms related to feature selection
* feature extraction with PCA
9 different machine learning algorithms were evaluated by applying the methods.== 
The dataset contains 400 samples and 24 attributes. The main purpose of the study is to determine the effective algorithms that can be used in the diagnosis of CKD by determining the prediction model with the highest accuracy rate.
